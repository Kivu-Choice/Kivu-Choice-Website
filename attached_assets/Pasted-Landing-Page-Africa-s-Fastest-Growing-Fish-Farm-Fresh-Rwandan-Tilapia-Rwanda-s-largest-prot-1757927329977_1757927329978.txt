Social Impact
Fighting Malnutrition Through
Fish Powder Innovation
Kivu Choice is transforming our premium tilapia into nutrient-dense fish powder to combat childhood stunting and malnutrition across Rwanda. Our innovative approach provides more nutrition per dollar than any other protein source.

57% of infant's daily nutrient requirement provided by just $0.10 worth of fish powder

vs 56% from a whole egg

8.5x more cost-effective than other protein sources (delete - not true)

Fish powder: $8.50/kg vs Goat: $5.54/kg (delete - confusing)

3x smaller portions needed for same nutrition (delete - not that important)

Due to higher nutrient density (delete)

Addressing Rwanda's Nutrition Challenge

The Challenge

Childhood stunting affects 33% of children under 5 in Rwanda. Traditional protein sources are either too expensive or provide insufficient nutrients for optimal child development.

Our Solution

Fish powder from our premium tilapia provides the highest nutrition value per dollar of any animal-sourced food.

Why Fish Powder Wins

Higher protein content than eggs, meat, or dairy
Rich in omega-3 fatty acids for brain development
Contains calcium and vitamin D for bone growth
Easier to digest for weaning infants
Longer shelf life than fresh alternatives
